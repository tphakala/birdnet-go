func TestBufferAllocationTiming(t *testing.T) {
	// This test documents the critical fix for buffer allocation timing during RTSP reconfiguration.
	// 
	// THE PROBLEM:
	// When reconfiguring RTSP sources, we were getting "no analysis buffer found" errors because:
	// 1. UpdateMonitors was called BEFORE stopping old streams
	// 2. StopAllRTSPStreamsAndWait removed buffers 
	// 3. Buffer monitors tried to read from non-existent buffers
	// 4. New streams would start but monitors were already failing
	//
	// THE FIX:
	// The correct order of operations is now:
	// 1. Stop all old streams (removes old buffers)
	// 2. Replace audio channels (avoids panic from closed channels)
	// 3. Start new streams (allocates new buffers via initializeBuffersForSource)
	// 4. Update buffer monitors (starts monitoring the newly allocated buffers)
	//
	// This ensures that:
	// - Buffers are removed cleanly when streams stop
	// - New buffers are allocated when streams start
	// - Monitors only start reading AFTER buffers exist
	//
	// The key insight: UpdateMonitors must be called AFTER new streams have started
	// and allocated their buffers, not before or during the transition.

// TestChannelReplacementStrategy documents the channel replacement strategy
// used to avoid "send on closed channel" panics.
func TestChannelReplacementStrategy(t *testing.T) {
	// This test documents the channel replacement strategy implemented to avoid panics.
	//
	// THE PROBLEM:
	// Closing channels with multiple senders causes "send on closed channel" panics.
	// This is a fundamental Go anti-pattern that cannot be safely handled.
	//
	// THE FIX:
	// Instead of closing channels, we:
	// 1. Create NEW channels
	// 2. Stop the old goroutine by closing its done channel
	// 3. Drain the old channel with a timeout to prevent goroutine leaks
	// 4. Start a new goroutine with the new channels
	//
	// This ensures:
	// - No panics from sending to closed channels
	// - Clean goroutine lifecycle management
	// - No goroutine leaks from abandoned drain operations
	//
	// The drain timeout (5 seconds) prevents infinite goroutine leaks if
	// data keeps arriving on the old channel.
