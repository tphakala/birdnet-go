**Setup (5 minutes):**

```bash
# Clone and setup everything
git clone https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go.git && cd birdnet-go

# Install Task (modern replacement for make)
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b /usr/local/bin

# Setup development tools (Go, Node.js, tools, git hooks)
task setup-dev

source ~/.profile  # If Go was just installed

# Develop with hot reload
air realtime  # or 'task dev_server'

# Before commit (auto-runs via git hooks anyway)
# Lint Go code
golangci-lint run

# Lint frontend code
task frontend-quality

# Commit (pre-commit hook auto-formats & lints)
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git commit -m "feat(scope): what you did"
```

**Key Rules:**

- ‚ùå No API v1 expansion ‚Üí use `internal/api/v2/`
- ‚ùå No telemetry without explicit user opt-in
- ‚ùå No `any` types in TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Frontend is embedded in Go binary (use `air`, not Vite dev server)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks auto-format & lint (can't commit broken code)
- ‚úÖ AI-assisted coding encouraged (Claude Code, CodeRabbit) - use responsibly

   - [`frontend/CLAUDE.md`](frontend/CLAUDE.md) - Svelte 5 frontend guidelines
   - [`internal/api/v2/CLAUDE.md`](internal/api/v2/CLAUDE.md) - API v2 guidelines

   **Note:** These CLAUDE.md files are optimized for AI-assisted coding tools (particularly Claude Code), but serve as comprehensive project guidelines for all contributors, whether using AI assistance or coding manually.

## Development Environment Setup

BirdNET-Go requires:

- **Go** 1.25 or later
- **Node.js** 22.x or later (LTS)
- **Build tools** (gcc, git, wget, etc.)
- **TensorFlow Lite** C library (auto-downloaded on first build, or installed by dev container)

### Option 1: Automated Setup with Taskfile (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to get started on **Linux (apt-based)** or **macOS (with Homebrew)**.

#### Step 1: Install Task Runner

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:** The installation scripts below download and execute code from the internet. Review the scripts before running if security is a concern:

- [Task install script](https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)
- [Homebrew install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

**Linux:**

```bash
# Install Task (required for automated setup)
# Note: The setup-dev task will also install Task if not present, but you need Task to run it
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b /usr/local/bin
```

**macOS:**

```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Task
brew install go-task
```

**Alternative:** If you already have Go installed, you can install Task via Go:

```bash
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
# Add $HOME/go/bin to your PATH if not already done
```

#### Step 2: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go.git
cd birdnet-go

# Run automated setup (installs all dependencies)
task setup-dev
```

The `setup-dev` task will automatically:

- ‚úÖ Detect your operating system
- ‚úÖ Install Go 1.25.3
- ‚úÖ Install Node.js LTS
- ‚úÖ Install build tools (gcc, git, wget, curl, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Install ARM64 cross-compilation tools (Linux only)
- ‚úÖ Install golangci-lint (Go linter)
- ‚úÖ Install air (hot reload for Go)
- ‚úÖ Install frontend dependencies (npm packages)
- ‚úÖ Install Playwright browsers for E2E testing
- ‚úÖ Initialize git hooks (Husky pre-commit checks)
- ‚úÖ Verify all installations

**Git Hooks (Pre-commit Checks):**

The setup automatically configures git pre-commit hooks using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) that will:

- **Go files:** Auto-format with `gofmt` and lint with `golangci-lint`
- **Frontend files:** Auto-format with Prettier, lint with ESLint and Stylelint
- **TypeScript:** Run type checking on staged files

These hooks **prevent commits with linting or type errors**, ensuring code quality. The hooks run automatically before each commit.

**Note:** If Go is installed for the first time, you may need to run:

```bash
source ~/.profile  # or restart your shell
```

#### Step 3: Build and Run

```bash
# Build the project
task

# Start development server with hot reload
task dev_server

# Or use air directly for realtime mode
air realtime
```

### Option 2: Dev Container (VS Code)

For a consistent, containerized development environment with all tools pre-configured.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

#### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go.git
   cd birdnet-go
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code:**

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Reopen in Container:**
   - Press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - Wait for the container to build and setup to complete (~5-10 minutes on first run)

4. **Start developing:**
   The container automatically runs [`.devcontainer/postCreateCommand.sh`](.devcontainer/postCreateCommand.sh) which:
   - Downloads and configures TensorFlow Lite headers and C library
   - Installs all Go development tools (air, golangci-lint, gopls, dlv)
   - Installs frontend dependencies
   - Sets up Oh My Posh for enhanced terminal experience
   - Verifies all installations

#### Dev Container Features

The dev container includes:

- **Pre-configured VS Code extensions:**
  - Go (golang.go)
  - Svelte (svelte.svelte-vscode)
  - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint
  - Playwright for E2E testing
  - TailwindCSS IntelliSense
- **Multiple shell options:** bash, zsh (with Oh My Zsh), fish, PowerShell
- **Port forwarding:** Port 8080 (BirdNET-Go server)
- **Automatic linting and formatting:** Configured to format on save

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reload Development

BirdNET-Go uses [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for hot reloading during development. The configuration is defined in [`.air.toml`](.air.toml).

#### Using Air

```bash
# Run BirdNET-Go in realtime analysis mode with Air
air realtime
```

**What Air Does:**

1. Watches for changes in:
   - Go source files (`*.go`)
   - Frontend files (`*.svelte`, `*.ts`, `*.js`, `*.css`)
   - Configuration files (`tailwind.config.js`, `vite.config.js`, etc.)
2. Automatically rebuilds frontend (Svelte + Tailwind CSS)
3. Recompiles Go binary with embedded frontend
4. Restarts the server automatically

**Important:** The frontend is **embedded** in the Go binary during build. Air handles the full rebuild pipeline automatically.

#### Using Task for Development

```bash
# Full development server (recommended)
task dev_server

# Frontend-only rebuild
task frontend-build

# Frontend development mode (use with caution - see warning below)
task frontend-dev
```

### Frontend Development

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The frontend is **embedded into Go binaries** at build time. Do **NOT** use the Vite dev server (`npm run dev` or `task frontend-dev`) for normal development, as changes won't be reflected in the Go server.

**Why Frontend is Embedded:**

- BirdNET-Go serves the frontend as static files embedded in the Go binary
- This ensures single-binary deployment without external frontend dependencies
- Air automatically rebuilds and embeds the frontend on every change

**Frontend Build Process:**

1. Svelte 5 components are compiled to static files
2. Vite bundles JavaScript, CSS, and assets
3. Go's `embed` directive embeds the `frontend/dist` directory
4. Result: Self-contained binary with embedded UI

**When to Use Vite Dev Server:**

Only use `task frontend-dev` when:

- Doing rapid UI prototyping with hot module replacement
- Testing Svelte component behavior in isolation
- Running frontend tests

For all other development, use `air` or `task dev_server` which handles the full build pipeline.

### Building the Project

```bash
# Default build (auto-detects platform)
task

# Build for specific platforms
task linux_amd64
task linux_arm64
task darwin_amd64
task darwin_arm64
task windows_amd64

# Build without embedded models (smaller binary)
task noembed (used with Docker builds)

# Clean build artifacts
task clean
```

## Code Quality and Linting

**All code must pass linting before being committed.**

### Go Linting

Configuration: [`.golangci.yaml`](.golangci.yaml)

```bash
# Run all Go linters
golangci-lint run -v

# Run on specific files
golangci-lint run -v internal/api/v2/media.go

# Run on entire v2 API
golangci-lint run -v ./internal/api/v2/...

# Auto-fix issues where possible
golangci-lint run --fix
```

**Pre-commit requirement:** All Go code must pass `golangci-lint run -v` with zero errors.

### Frontend Linting

Configuration files:

- ESLint: `frontend/eslint.config.js`
- Prettier: `frontend/.prettierrc`
- Stylelint: `frontend/.stylelintrc.json`
- TypeScript: `frontend/tsconfig.json`

```bash
# Comprehensive quality check (recommended)
task frontend-quality

# Individual checks
task frontend-lint           # ESLint + Prettier + Stylelint
task frontend-typecheck      # TypeScript type checking
npm run ast:all              # AST-grep security/pattern checks

# Auto-fix issues
task frontend-lint-fix       # Fix ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint issues
npm run check:fix            # Format + lint auto-fix
```

**Pre-commit requirement:** All frontend code must pass `npm run check:all` with zero errors.

### Git Hooks (Pre-commit Automation)

Git hooks are automatically configured during `task setup-dev` using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/). The pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) runs before every commit to ensure code quality.

**What the pre-commit hook does:**

1. **Go files:**
   - Auto-formats with `gofmt` and re-stages formatted files
   - Runs `golangci-lint run -v` on all staged Go files
   - Blocks commit if linting fails
2. **Frontend files:**
   - Runs `lint-staged` (Prettier + ESLint + Stylelint) on staged files
   - Runs TypeScript type checking on staged `.ts` and `.svelte` files
   - Blocks commit if any checks fail

**Manual initialization (if needed):**

```bash
# Initialize Husky git hooks
cd frontend
npm run prepare

# Verify hook is installed
ls -la ../.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Bypassing hooks (not recommended):**

```bash
# Skip pre-commit checks (strongly discouraged)
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The `--no-verify` flag is **strongly discouraged** and bypassed commits may be rejected during code review. Fix linting issues instead of bypassing checks.

**Troubleshooting:**

```bash
# If hooks aren't running, reinitialize
cd frontend && npm run prepare

# If golangci-lint not found in hook
which golangci-lint  # Ensure it's in PATH
echo $PATH           # Check if $HOME/go/bin is in PATH
```

### AST-Grep Code Analysis

BirdNET-Go uses [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) for advanced code pattern matching and security analysis.

```bash
# Run all AST-grep checks
cd frontend
npm run ast:all

# Individual checks
npm run ast:security         # Security pattern scanning
npm run ast:svelte5          # Svelte 5 best practices
npm run ast:migration        # Svelte 4 ‚Üí 5 migration checks
npm run ast:best-practices   # General best practices

# Auto-fix issues
npm run ast:fix
```

See [`frontend/doc/AST-GREP-SETUP.md`](frontend/doc/AST-GREP-SETUP.md) for complete ast-grep usage guide.

## Testing

### Go Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
task test

# Run with verbose output
task test-verbose

# Run with coverage
task test-coverage

# Run with race detector
go test -race -v ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test -v ./internal/api/v2/...
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
task frontend-test

# Unit tests with coverage
task frontend-test-coverage

# E2E tests with Playwright
task e2e-test

# E2E tests in headed mode (for debugging)
task e2e-test-headed

# E2E tests with UI mode
task e2e-test-ui

# Open E2E test report
task e2e-report
```
